# Commitish

A simple, lightweight commitizen-like tool for creating standardized Git commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

## üìñ Overview

Commitish streamlines your Git workflow by helping you craft well-formatted commit messages without needing to remember the conventional commits syntax. It provides an interactive interface to select commit types, add scopes, and include detailed descriptions when needed.

## ‚ú® Features

- Interactive commit type selection using fuzzy search
- Support for all standard conventional commit types
- Optional scoping of commits
- Optional multi-line commit body
- Breaking changes notation
- Verification of Git repository and staged changes

## üîß Dependencies

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Command-line fuzzy finder
- Git

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download the script:

```bash
curl -o /usr/local/bin/commitish https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victor141516/commitish/refs/heads/master/commitish
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/commitish
```

## üìã Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
commitish
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select a commit type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
2. Optionally provide a scope
3. Enter a commit message
4. Optionally specify breaking changes

### Examples

Start with a specific commit type:

```bash
commitish fix  # Pre-selects the "fix" type
```

Include a multi-line commit body:

```bash
commitish -b
```

Combine type and body flag:

```bash
commitish feat -b
```

### Options

```
-h, --help     Show the help message and exit
-b, --body     Include a commit body (multi-line description)
```
